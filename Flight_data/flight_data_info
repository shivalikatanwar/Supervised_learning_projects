    • pandas >= 1.2.4

Question 1
The aim of question 1 is to check if all “data scientist daily tasks” are mastered, from processing raw data to model building.
Simulated flight signals representing fuel flow (in pound per second), altitude (in feet), wind (in knots) and speed (in km/h) are stored in the question1 folder of the archive in DataFrame format. Each Dataframe stores signals in the following structure:
    1. indexes: time vector
    2. columns: number of flights
Dataframes can be read with pickle reader method, for example:
output = pd.read_pickle("signals_altitude.pkl")

Note that time vector can be different from one flight number to another.

Write a script or a notebook which contains all the step to answer below questions. 
    1) Explain the data processing steps to select the best features and prepare them for the learning phase.

    2) Build a fuel flow model as a function of:
        a. effective speed range of data
        b. constant altitude of 8000 ft
        c. why not wind speed?

    3) Build fuel flow model as a function of:
        a.  [0-15000] ft altitude range
        b. constant speed of 665 km/h
        c. why not wind speed?

    4) Bonus question: Build fuel flow model as a function of speed and altitude on the effective range of data
